Inspired by [url=www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lootr] the Minecraft mod of the same name [/url], Lootr brings a fresh, multiplayer-friendly loot system to Terraria. Say goodbye to empty chests and loot stealing—Lootr ensures that every player gets their own unique rewards from chests and containers across the world.

Whether you're exploring dungeons, raiding sky islands, or delving deep into the Underworld, every lootable container will generate separate loot for each player, creating a fair and balanced experience for multiplayer sessions. No more arguments over who gets the best gear—Lootr makes sure everyone gets their share.

Perfect for co-op adventures, modpacks, or large servers, Lootr enhances the thrill of exploration and discovery in a seamless and intuitive way.
